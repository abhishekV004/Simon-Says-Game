# Simon Says Game 🎮

A simple memory-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The player must remember and replicate an increasingly complex sequence of button presses.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of button flashes carefully.
3. Click the buttons in the same order as shown.
4. The sequence grows by one each level — how far can you go?
5. If you click the wrong button, the game ends and your score is displayed.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic level progression.
- Colorful button animations.
- Game over feedback and automatic reset.
- Fully responsive design for modern browsers.
